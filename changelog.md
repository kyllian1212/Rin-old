# Old Rin changelog

This was a very early version of Rin, created as an emergency after the old Sad Machine bot died, to keep the report features working. It wasn't announced publically at all in either the Porter Robinson Discord or the Madeon Discord until v1.0.0. 

Fun fact: most of the functionality on those old Rin versions was contained in only one file! (which was a mess)

(date format is dd/mm/yyyy)
